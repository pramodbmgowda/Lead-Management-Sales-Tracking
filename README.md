Lead Management & Sales Tracking
* Industry: Retail / Services 
* Project Type: B2B Salesforce CRM Implementation
* Target Users: Sales Agents, Sales Managers, and Prospective Customers


Problem Statement
A sales team relies on spreadsheets and email to manage leads, causing inefficiencies and missed opportunities. Follow-ups are delayed, duplicate leads exist, and managers lack real-time visibility into the sales funnel. Without a centralized CRM, forecasting and performance tracking become unreliable.
To overcome these challenges, the company wants to implement a Salesforce CRM to:
* Automate lead capture and routing
* Improve follow-up and customer engagement
* Provide managers with real-time sales insights
* Ensure data accuracy and consistency


The Salesforce solution will support the following key business processes:
* Lead Management
   * Capture leads automatically from website forms and campaigns.
   * Route leads to appropriate agents based on geography or product line.
   * Qualify leads using priority, source, or scoring rules.
* Follow-up & Nurturing
   * Automate reminders and notifications for timely customer follow-ups.
   * Track lead activities (emails, calls, meetings) in Salesforce.
   * Update lead status dynamically (New → Working → Converted → Closed).
* Sales Tracking
   * Monitor conversion rates across different lead sources.
   * Provide managers with dashboards to view active leads, bottlenecks, and rep performance.
   * Forecast the sales pipeline based on real-time data.
* Reporting & Analytics
   * Build dashboards for monthly lead conversion trends.
   * Track agent activity and response times.
   * Analyze sales funnel performance to optimize campaigns.
